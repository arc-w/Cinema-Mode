To setup program again, delete CinemaMode_arc-w.txt (which is located in the same forlder as CinemaMode.exe) or change "1" to "0" in the first line.
You can change any settings in the CinemaMode_arc-w.txt, as long as "1" at the first line is present, program will automatically take all data from that file.
