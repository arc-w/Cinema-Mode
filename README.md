*Cinema Mode*
Imagine, you've been coding all day, and when the today's work is done, you just want to chill and watch some Netflix/YouTube. This tool is basically a "switch" to enable a "Cinema Mode".
What this program does is
1. Closes all opened apps
2. Opens your browser and preffered website
3. Enters fullscreen
4. Change your default audio playback device to the one you use to watch anything.
At the first run, the tool will run a setup (ask to choose device, browser, website, etc.). Settings file will be created. The next run program will function automatically.
To run a setup again, delete settings file (CinemaMode_arc-w.txt (which is located in the same folder as CinemaMode.exe)) or change "1" to "0" in the first line of it.
You can change settungs anytime in the CinemaMode_arc-w.txt, as long as "1" at the first line is present, program will automatically take all data from that file.
(If your PC is potato and fails to load everything in time, you can change all pauses duration in code)

Supports all browsers.
Only for OS Windows.
(PS: It can also handle any app, as long as you know it's .exe location and the process name is the same as file's name(if not, delete isBrowserOpen part in main))
